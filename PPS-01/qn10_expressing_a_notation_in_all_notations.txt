To express the function f(n) = n^3/1000 - 100n^2 - 100n - 3 in terms of the notations θ, O, Ω, o, ω, we need to analyze its growth rate in different scenarios.

1. θ-notation (Theta): The function f(n) is said to be θ(g(n)) if it is both O(g(n)) and Ω(g(n)). It means that f(n) grows at the same rate as g(n) within a constant factor.
In this case, we can express f(n) as θ(n^3), since all the other terms (-100n^2, -100n, -3) become insignificant as n grows.

2. O-notation (Big O): The function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) if f(n) grows at most as fast as g(n) asymptotically.
In this case, we can express f(n) as O(n^3), since the highest degree term dominates the growth rate.

3. Ω-notation (Big Omega): The function f(n) is said to be Ω(g(n)) if f(n) grows at least as fast as g(n) asymptotically.
In this case, we can express f(n) as Ω(n^3), since the highest degree term dominates the growth rate.

4. o-notation (Small o): The function f(n) is said to be o(g(n)) if f(n) grows strictly slower than g(n) asymptotically.
In this case, we can express f(n) as o(n^4), since n^4 grows faster than n^3.

5. ω-notation (Small Omega): The function f(n) is said to be ω(g(n)) if f(n) grows strictly faster than g(n) asymptotically.
In this case, we can express f(n) as ω(1), since any constant is growing slower than any polynomial term.

To summarize:

f(n) = θ(n^3)
f(n) = O(n^3)
f(n) = Ω(n^3)
f(n) = o(n^4)
f(n) = ω(1)
